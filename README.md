# Final BSc project
This is my final BSc project: Characterizing efficient referrals in social networks, that led to a paper accepted to the WebConf 2018.

In this project, I used machine learning models to predict efficient referrals in Reddit's forums.

The paper can be found here: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3184558.3186910
